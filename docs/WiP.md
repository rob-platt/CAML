# Features Currently in Development

- Additional colours for all minerals in the classifier dataset.

# Requests

- If someone has a python port of the IDL map projection code, that would be immensely helpful. This would allow for direct use of data in GIS software, and remove the need for expensive IDL licenses. The entire software pipeline would then be FOSS.

If there are additional features you would like for this software, please contact the developers via email rp1818@ic.ac.uk, raise an issue on the GitHub repository, or submit a pull request with the feature you would like to see.
